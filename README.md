# SampleSuperstore-Data-Analysis
This is my first data analytics project that I've decided to conduct on my own, using the "SampleSuperstore" dataset I retrieved from Kaggle. Here I used Google Sheets to do my data cleaning, and MySQL Workbench to do my data wrangling, then I finally proceeded to use Power BI for dashboard creation. This project was definitely very fun to work on, especially with this being my first time using a dataset this large. It may not be perfect but I hope you'll be able to learn and understand the insights gained from this project. 

xoxo, polark.
