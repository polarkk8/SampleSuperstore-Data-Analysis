# SampleSuperstore-Data-Analysis
This is my first data analytics project that I've decided to conduct on my own, using the "SampleSuperstore" dataset I retrieved from Kaggle. Here I used Google Sheets to do my data cleaning, and MySQL Workbench to do my data wrangling, then I finally proceeded to use Power BI for dashboard creation. This project was definitely very fun to work on, especially with this being my first time using a dataset this large. It may not be perfect but I hope you'll be able to learn and understand the insights gained from this project. 

The raw 'SampleSuperstore' dataset from Kaggle and my cleaned version are also listed as CSV files.

The information I decided to pull from the dataset and work with was purely my decision and my own work, while pretending I was working with Stakeholders from Superstore. I decided to analyze sales performance to identify key insights such as profitabiliy issues and opportunities for example by State and Category, and presenting the findings in an interactive dashboard.

The completed dashboard can be found in the documents listed as 'Completed SuperstoreData Dashboard.pbix'. The CSV files listed are those of the exported results, most of which is used for my dashboard from my SQL Script, which is also listed as 'superstore_sales_datawrangling.sql'.

For the first dashboard created, I provided sales performance analysis, which can be seen for any preferred State, Category, Segment or ShipMode. The Total Sales for each State across all Categories are presented on the map provided. Also I went along to calculate the Total Profit and Profit Margin across all sales from Superstore. The Total Profit earned is shown to be $286.24K from Total Sales of $2.29M, while their profit margin is 12.47%, as can be seen displayed on all three (3) dashboards, as these are vital pieces of inoformation.

The second dashboard showcases Sales performance by State and City, which I put together in bar charts. I was able to show each of the Top 20 States and Top 20 Cities,respectively, bringing in the Most Sales for Superstore.

The third and final dashboard gives the stakeholders at Superstore a further doubling-down on their Sales data by providing them with performance for each of their Categories and SubCategories. Also, I found it fit to show each of the SubCategories and the Total Sales incurred by each which are included in the Top 100 Highest Sales made by Superstore. Stakeholders also wished to find out how the Sales performance of Chairs was and I did so by showcasing the Total Sales and Total Profit incurred across all States and Cities, which can be seen displayed in a simple bar chart. 

Values on the dashboards can be seen by selecting or hovering over any specific feature on the vizualizations.

xoxo, polark.
